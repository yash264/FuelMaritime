💭 Short Essay: Reflections on Using AI Agents

Using AI agents like ChatGPT in building the FuelMaritime backend greatly improved development speed and structure. I learned how AI can guide architectural design, automate repetitive coding, and help apply patterns like Hexagonal Architecture more effectively. The process showed that AI is not just a code generator, but a real assistant in decision-making, refactoring, and documentation.

⚡ Efficiency Gains

Compared to manual coding, AI-driven development was about 2–3 times faster. Tasks such as creating Prisma models, repository layers, and environment setup were completed quickly and consistently. Instead of spending hours debugging or researching syntax, I could focus on logic, testing, and validation. The AI also improved accuracy by generating cleaner and more uniform code across modules.

🔧 Future Improvements

Next time, I’d automate setup scripts, add Swagger-based API docs, and maintain a stronger prompt structure for consistency. I’d also integrate test automation and deployment workflows earlier in the process.

🧠 Key Takeaway

AI tools significantly enhance productivity, especially when combined with human oversight. They streamline backend creation, reduce errors, and accelerate learning — turning what used to be a long, manual process into a guided, efficient collaboration.
